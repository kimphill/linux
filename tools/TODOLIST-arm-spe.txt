record arm_spe_0 and arm_spe_1 simultaneously
events aren't "task bound" (?)

./perf record -vv -c 1024 -e arm_spe_0/ts_enable=1,pa_enable=0/ true

gives:

> mmap size 266240B
> AUX area mmap length 131072
> perf event ring buffer mmapped per cpu
> failed to mmap AUX area
> failed to mmap with 524 (INTERNAL ERROR: strerror_r(524, 0xffffc8596038, 512)=22)

vs. ./perf record -vvv -e context-switches true
> ... so I guess this has something to do with the way the tool tries to
> use the cpumask, maknig the wrong assumption that this implies
> system-wide collection is mandatory / expected.
